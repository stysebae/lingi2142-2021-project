# OVH Network

This is a part of the "Computer Networks: Configuration and Management" course (LINGI2142, UCLouvain, academic year 2020-2021). The aim of this project is to develop a model of the OVH network (a large cloud provider based in France), configure it and manage it. 

## Initial Model

We have chosen a subpart of the OVH network as shown below (source: [OVH's Weathermap](http://weathermap.ovh.net/)):

We could represent it by the following model:

Keep in mind this scheme, because it is the basis of our network configuration.
