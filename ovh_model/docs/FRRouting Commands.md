# FRRouting Commands

## Reminder: some IPMininet useful commands

- `nodes`: display nodes
- `links` or `net`: display links
- `<node|switch|controller> cmd`: execute `cmd` on the specified node (e.g.: `ovh_r1 ifconfig -a`)
- `<node1> ping -c x <node2>`: test connectivity between `node1` and `node2` (where `x` is an integer)
- `dump`: display all information about the nodes

## Connection to FRRouting daemons

To access to the configuration of FRRouting (within the IPMininet CLI), you have to use `telnet` to connect to FRRouting daemons.

A different port is used to access to every routing daemon. This small table shows the port associated to its default daemon:

| Port     | State | Service | Comments                                             |
|----------|-------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 2601/tcp | open  | zebra   | controls the Routing Information Base (RIB) of each daemon                      |
| 2605/tcp | open  | bgpd    | show information related to the configuration of BGP |
| 2606/tcp | open  | ospf6d  | same but for OSPFv3 (OSPF for IPv6)                  |

To use it, type the following command: `[noecho] <node> telnet localhost XXXX` where XXXX is either 2601, 2605 or 2606 (for example: `noecho ovh_r1 telnet localhost 2606`). A new CLI interface will be shown. Type `zebra` as password in order to have the FRRouting CLI.

The commands listed below assume that you are using FRRouting CLI.

## RIB

- `show ip route`: show all the routes contained in the RIB

## BGP
- `router bgp AS_NBR`: activate BGP on the router an set his AS number
- `network SUBNET_IP/MASK`: choose the network on which advertise BGP
- `neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP remote-as REMOTE_AS_NBR`: define the neighbor as a member of remote AS
- `neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP prefix-list PREFIX_NAME in`: set the ingoing filter for the interface
- `neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP prefix-list PREFIX_NAME out`: set the outgoing filter for the interface
- `neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP update-source INTERFACE_NAME`: set the loopback addresss of the neighbor (the interface as to be set previously by : "interface loopback 0 \n ip adress LOOPBACK_IP 255.255.255.255")
- `set community COMMUNITY`: set the BGP community value
- `set local-preference X`: set the local-pref on the link
- `show bgp summary`: outputs a summary of the status of the BGP sessions on the local router.

## OSPF

(Commands known via `<node> telnet localhost 2606`)  
Debug commands:  

- `show ip ospf`: general information about OSPF on the router
- `show ip ospf database`: information about the link state database
- `show ip ospf route`: show the OSPF topology table
- `show ip ospf route summary`: give a summary of the OSPF routes
- `show ip ospf neighbor`: display OSPF-neighbor information on a per-interface basis
- `show ip ospf interface`: provide information about each of the routerâ€™s interfaces.
- `show ip ospf spf tree`: ASCII representation of the shortest path tree

**We have to choose an interface of the router (with the `interface` command) before executing the following commands !**  
OSPF uses hello packets and two timers to check if a neighbor is still alive or not. One timer is the "hello timer" which defines the frequency at which we have to send the hello packet and the second is the "dead interval" wich defines how long we should wait for hello packets before we declare the neighbor dead. A router send hello packet to his neighbors to tell them he is still alive.  

We can change the value of the two timers with the commands:  

- `ip ospf hello-interval X` (where X is the interval in seconds)
- `ip ospf dead-interval X` (where X is the interval in seconds)

We can also use other commands to change some parameters of one interface at the time:  

- `router ospf PID`: enable OSPF on the router
- `network IP_ADDRESS WILDCARD_MASK area AREA_NBR`: set the inteface on which OSPF will run and his area number
- `ip address IP_ADDRESS SUBNET_MASK`: change the ip address on the selected interface
- `ip ospf cost X`: define the cost of the link connected at the selected interface
- `ip ospf priority X`: change the chances of the router to be the OSPF designated router (who act as the main point of contact for the network segment)
- `neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP COST`: define a cost to reach a specific neighbor
